## Landscape Architecture

At Bishop Engineering we aim for simplicity and classic design in our landscape  architecture services. Our landscape projects are designed with an emphasis on natural  settings that fit the distinctive features of your site rather than overlooking  or trying to disguise them. We believe it is important to use native plants and  grasses when completing your project to ensure we leave you with a beautiful, sustainable,  and easy-to-care-for result.

Our landscape architects respond to your needs and desires by providing you with  low impact development solutions that meet your expectations and create a unique design. At Bishop Engineering we support environmentally conscious innovations and  believe it’s important to let nature into your space, giving you and your community a place to grow and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors.
